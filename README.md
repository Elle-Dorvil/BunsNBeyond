# Project Title
Sandwich Shop - BunsNBeyond

## Description of the Project

Java-based command-line application that simulates a sandwich shop ordering system. Users can create custom sandwich orders by choosing bread, size, toppings, chips, and drinks. The system calculates the subtotal for each item and provides a final total at checkout.

- As a customer, I want to view my full order summary before checkout, so that I can confirm my selections and total cost.
- As a cashier, I want to save each order to a timestamped receipt file, so that there is a record of all transactions.
- As a customer, I want to add chips to my order, so that I can complete my meal.
- As a customer, I want to add drinks to my order, so that I can quench my thirst.
- As a cashier, I want to be able to cancel an order, so that I can help the customer start over if they change their mind.
